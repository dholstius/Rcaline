\usage{
Caline3Model(links, meteorology, receptors, terrain, pollutant)
}
\arguments{
\item{links}{a \code{\link{FreeFlowLinks}} object}

\item{meteorology}{a \code{\link{Meteorology}} object}

\item{receptors}{a \code{\link{Receptors}} object}

\item{terrain}{a \code{\link{Terrain}} object}

\item{pollutant}{a \code{\link{Pollutant}} object}
}
\value{
a Caline3Model object
}
\description{
Construct, run, summarize and show results from a Caline3Model object.
}
\details{
The model (object) contains all of the link and met data,
as well as site-specific model parameters, such as surface roughness.
Internally, these are stored as single-precision arrays. If you want to
experiment by changing a parameter, construct a new Caline3Model, unless
you really know what you are doing.

Use \code{predict} to predict concentrations; \code{aggregate} to compute summary statistics,
such as means and maxima; and \code{spplot} or \code{ggplot} to visualize results.
